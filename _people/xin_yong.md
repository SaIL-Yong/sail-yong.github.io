Xin Yong received his BS degree in physics at Peking University in 2007 and PhD degree in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in 2012. Prior to joining UB, he conducted postdoctoral research at the University of Pittsburgh and held the positions of Assistant Professor and Associate Professor at Binghamton University. Dr. Yong's research employs multiscale approaches for simulating and modeling fluid dynamics and transport phenomena in soft and active matter, focusing on emergent interfacial behaviors within these systems. Particularly, his research interests include the electrospray of complex fluids, biomembrane mechanics, interactions between micro/nanoplastics and cells, and the hydrodynamics of microswimmers.
