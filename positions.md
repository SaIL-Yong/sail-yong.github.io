### Open Positions

Our lab has two immediate openings at different levels: a fully funded PhD student and a two-year postdoctoral associate to work on research projects at the forefront of multiphase fluid dynamics and soft matter physics. We are looking for motivated researchers interested in fundamental research in colloid and interface science with degrees in mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, mechanics, or applied physics. For PhD applicants, M.S. with project/research experience and publication record is strongly preferred. Candidates should have a strong background in applied math and physics and knowledge of colloid science, multiphase flow, biophysics, or soft matter physics. Good programming skills in C/C++, Python, or MATLAB are required. For Postdoc applicants, experience with experimental methods in electrospray, microfluidics, microscopy, and image analysis are required. Candidates should also have good communication skills and are open to collaboration.

Interested candidates are invited to email <a href="mailto:xinyong@buffalo.edu">Dr. Xin Yong</a> with a CV, contact information of 2-3 references, and a brief description of your research experience and motivation. PhD applicants should also provide unofficial B.S. (and M.S.) transcripts as well as TOEFL and GRE scores. More information about PhD admissions and applications can be found at: https://engineering.buffalo.edu/mechanical-aerospace/graduate/admissions.html.

**Dr. Xin Yong will attend the 2024 APS DFD Meeting at Salt Lake City in November. If you are interested in our positions and would like to have an in-person chat, please feel free to reach out.**
